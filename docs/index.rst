Treeval documentation
======================

Welcome to Treeval's documentation.

Treeval is a Python package providing an easy and flexible way to evaluate the matching between tree-based objects, i.e. dictionaries. It is particularly useful to evaluate the predictions of language models on `structured data extraction <https://numind.ai/blog/nuextract-a-foundation-model-for-structured-extraction>`_ tasks.
